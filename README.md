# Hi thes, I am Niranjan Kumar Sharma. I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
# Machine Learning
Now everyone move to Machine Learning technique like Google, Facebook, Amazon. With the help of ML algorithms, we try to predict the our target variable. With the help of statistic tools and algorithme train the model. 
Many Business like E-commerce, Real Estate, Retail, manufacturing, health etc are also use the Machine learning. It is very helpful for Company growth and its and decrease the its losses. There are many library like pandas, numpy, sklearn, stats_Model, Seaborn and matplotlib. With the help of numpy, pandas we can do  data cleaning, data processing and feature engineering part where we handle missing value, categorical values. With the help of seaborn and matplotlib library we can visualize the our dat, how our data look like and with the help sklearn library we are create our mdoel and train it. These all libraries are mostly used in Machine Learning techniques.
# Computer Vision
Computer Vision library, with the help of computer vision, we are try to learn the computer the object detection, face detection, recognazation, Image captioning etc. And with the help of Computer Vision, computer work like a human. It tell us this car, this horse, and manymore.
